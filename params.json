Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are\r\nreported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with\r\na sampling frequency no less than 118Hz. Also, an proof-of-concet dataset is provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope this site will be finished and ready to be use in a few days! ",
